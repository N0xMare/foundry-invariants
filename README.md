# Make your Foundry tests saucy
This repository is meant to provide some examples of the more advanced features of Foundry. The main focus as of now will be to show how to use the powerful invariant testing and fuzzing that foundry is capable of to make the most out of your contract's test suite.

If you have any recommendations for improvement or criticism please reach out to [me](https://twitter.com/N0xMare_) on twitter or send PR, my goal is to learn myself in the process of making this, how to write more professional contract tests and help others learn in the process.
